					<div class="col-1-2"> 
						<p>Background: Akzo Nobel, one of the largest international paint companies, needed a designer to layout the 2013 annual report. The publication needed to include information relevant to their shareholders, sections of company narrative, and a financials spread. The company requested that the designer include her 
own photography to insure that the report is fully customized 
to their brand. 

Solution: Many annual reports are cluttered and overwhelmed with text, but Akzo Nobel’s layout gives the reader visual breathing room through the use of negative space. The page numbers also function as ‘chapter’ numbers; clearly visible, the reader is never confused as to which section or page they are on. 

The color palette features a range of blue and green. Blue hues communicate a corporate mood, while green brings to mind images of rejuvenation and innovation. The color palette reflects Akzo Nobel’s company philosophy. Akzo Nobel consistantly strives to maintain their professionalism and better the world through 
their groundbreaking developements.

The typefaces are professional, but are not overly mechanical; 
the report’s text still appears inviting. 

The selected color palette is dispersed throughout the report; the blue and green hues are accompanied by midtone grey text that acts as an equalizing color throughout the book.  

Akzo Nobel’s annual report that mimics a color swatch book. By utilizing colors specifically from the Akzo Nobel brand, the annual report doubles as an informational report and an advertising piece. 

Annual reports can sometimes present dry information, but the goal was to create visual interest and boost the likelihood that a shareholder would take time to read the presented information.
