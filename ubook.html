					<div class="single-col mult-paragraphs"> 
					 	<p> UBook is an event management system for church and nonprofit administrators and secretaries. Event management consists of scheduling events (finding the appropriate room and time), viewing events, approving events (for the board members and administrators), and generating printable reports 
						for all involved. </p>

						<p>Ubook saves people time. Managing data by hand is an extremely time intensive procedure. The application allows people to use their time to serve people, rather than crunch numbers or do things that computers can do better.</p>

						<p>UBook saves people money. Buying software is expensive. So, the software is free.</p>

						<p>Ubook saves people frustration. Handling data by hand leads to one person becoming a bottle neck to the process. It’s also suspect to data loss and misunderstanding. By moving online, churches and nonprofits can avoid this problem.</p>

					<h2 class="project-h2 ubook-header">Solution</h2>

					<div class="single-col mult-paragraphs">
						<p>After collaborating together, uBook’s tightknit brother sister team developed an event management application that is simple. The purpose of every page is evident. Every item on the page has a clear, unambiguous job. The interface promotes ease of use and the core functions of the site are presented in an obvious spots that require as few clicks as possible. </p>

						<p>Users create events using familiar calendar interactions, comparable to event reminder systems like Apple Calendar and Google Calendar (selecting an open time and date on the calendar activates an event creation sequence). Users can also search for existing events by typing directly into the search bar or by toggling various filters that detail event locations and specific attributes (equipment, reoccurance, etc). A view specific to administrators allows management to review and approve events.</p>

						<p>Ubook’s logotype references the appointment booking process (which revolves around an event’s timing). Additionally, the logo-type emphasizes the application’s timesaving quality, the reduced time it takes to create and manage events.</p>
